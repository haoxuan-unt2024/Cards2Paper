##Summarize the definition of LFM from multiple papers and define the attribute sets for both model cards and data cards.
##Provide the LLM with these definitions together with the original card text so it can determine whether the card qualifies as an LFM, identify which attributes are present, and calculate the information completeness score (or Data Dirtiness Score).
##Manually check the labels produced by the LLM. (like 100 cards)
